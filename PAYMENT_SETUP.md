# Payment System Setup Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Your application is now running with a **mock payment system** for development. All features are working:

- ‚úÖ Ticket selection and shopping cart
- ‚úÖ Order creation with inventory management  
- ‚úÖ Mock payment processing (instant success)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications with QR codes
- ‚úÖ Digital wallet integration (Apple Wallet & Google Pay)
- ‚úÖ Availability deduction after payment confirmation
- ‚úÖ Order confirmation and ticket management

## Testing the System

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev` (running on http://localhost:3001)
2. **Sign in** using Google OAuth or create an account
3. **Browse events** and select tickets
4. **Proceed to checkout** - the system will automatically use mock payment
5. **Check your email** for confirmation with QR codes
6. **View your order** in the confirmation page

## Setting Up Real Stripe Payments

To enable real payment processing with Stripe:

### 1. Get Stripe API Keys

1. Visit [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Create a free account or sign in
3. Go to **Developers** ‚Üí **API Keys**
4. Copy your **Publishable key** and **Secret key** (use test keys for development)

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env.local` file and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace these placeholder values with your real Stripe keys
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_REAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_REAL_SECRET_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
```

### 3. Set Up Webhooks (Optional for development)

For production, you'll need to set up webhooks:

1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the webhook secret to your `.env.local`

## Mock Payment System

While Stripe is not configured, the app uses a mock payment system that:

- ‚úÖ Simulates successful payments instantly
- ‚úÖ Processes orders and reduces ticket availability  
- ‚úÖ Sends confirmation emails with QR codes
- ‚úÖ Creates digital wallet passes
- ‚úÖ Updates order status to "CONFIRMED"

This allows full testing of the application flow without real payment processing.
